Introduction

In an age dominated by social media, the analysis of user-generated content presents a valuable opportunity to gain insights into public sentiment and mental well-being. This project aims to harness the power of machine learning to address two critical tasks: sentiment analysis of tweets and the detection of mental health conditions based on user behavior.

The objective of this project is to classify tweets as either positive or negative, enabling a deeper understanding of public sentiment on various topics.
Through this project, we aspire to contribute to both the fields of natural language processing and mental health awareness. By developing effective machine learning models for sentiment analysis and mental health detection, we aim to empower individuals, organizations, and healthcare professionals with valuable tools for understanding and supporting mental well-being in the digital age.
